2. Install all dependencies
3. Set up environment variables
4. Start database services
5. Build shared packages
6. Configure development environment

### Manual Setup
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

3. **Start databases**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Start development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
